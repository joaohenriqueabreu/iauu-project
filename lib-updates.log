# How to install / update library in development (automatically installed on prod)?

- Make any changes to local library repository;
- Run `ilib` bash command or `sudo cp -rf [project dir]/api/lib/* /var/lib/iauu` (this will copy library to environemnt folder correctly);
- Next stop running services that consume the library;
- Run `npm install` for that service;
- Run `npm run dev` to keep testing;
